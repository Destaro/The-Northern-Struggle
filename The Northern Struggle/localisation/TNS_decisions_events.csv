REVLT1.D;With the recent liberal revolutions engulfing the world, our hold on Britannia has become unstable. Local populace tends to unite more and more around the idea of independence. We have two options: to favour local collaborationists and try to ease the tensions, or to embrace old Viking ways and start settling these isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVLT2.D;Great news! Some folks from Scandianavia have gathered enough funds to estabilish first nordic settlements in Britannia! Now, the only thing we need to worry about is the unrest of the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVLT3.D;The separatists aren't even hiding anymore and have created the first local independence organisation. As things become more chaotic, we can only hope that they will not spread their ideas further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVLT4.D;It's outrageous! The local population, furious about our settlement programs has started violent actions against our fellow Scandinavians! Now, we must choose between cancelling local settlement funding or standing up to the Britannian nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVLT5.D;Finally, Britannians have started to understand their place in the world! We have finally managed to gather enough local support to establish a local collaborationist government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVLT6.D;It's a disaster! Despite our best efforts, these goddamned Bretannians have started preparing their independent government. Local referenda are being held and militias organised. Now, we must prepare troops to suppress them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVLT7.D;The Anglish were always very unruly, but today they have crossed the line and declared their independence! Now, we must show them the Scandianavian might and force them into submission, once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVLT8.D;It was not unexpected that lands that always were so disconnected from us sooner or later would rebel. But fortunately, we have a huge Swedish population in the north of the country that we can use as our holding there to restore control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
REVLT9.D;We were unfortunate enough to get probably the most rebellious people of Britannia as our main colony here,so an open rebellion was only a matter of time.

ENG7.T;Fate of Anglia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENG1.D;Angleserens are Scandinavian people that have settled in our lands a long time ago and created a new culture. Of course, there is a large debate taking place regarding them. The Anglish populace of course wants to fully expell them, but as they embraced many Bretannian traditions it may be wise to recognise them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENG2.D;Ah, Wales, land that was not affected by Scandinavian colonisation very much. With consolidation of our core lands the Welsh now see us as liberators and we can rule here as we please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENG3.D;Northumbrians are a bizzare identity that formed due to regionalism and mixing between Anglish and Danish. Hardline Anglish nationalists want to end their culture, calling them traitors of the Anglis nation, but their culture is very close to Anglish, so maybe it's unnecessary to cause more violence over some dialects?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENG4.D;So, the day has come, our Anglish brethern succesefuly rebelled! Many of our people are calling for a referendum to unite with them. Maybe it's a logical move, but northumbrian conservatives and nationalists express fear for destruction of our identity in Anglia. So, what should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENG5.D;We finally expelled Scandinavian occupants from our lands! It's unbeliveble that after all these years of oppression we are finally free and can speak our language without supervision! Now, let's get some beer and start celebrations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENG6.D;The Scotts have always wanted their local culture to be independent, and it would be very hard to crush them, so our intellectuals proposed a project to accept their culture. However, Anglish nationalists call for the settlement of the region. We have to decide the fate of those unruly northerners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENG7.D;With our independence after celebrations comes big problems, main of whic is our destiny. No, we are not just some proud nation-state, we destined to be greater than this! Main narrative of nationalists is to obviously unite Britannia under our rule, but some crazy intellectauls proposed to restore idea of Angevin state of Anglo-French, which actually can be a possibility due to coming independence war of Normandy and general chaos of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

AUS1.T;Austrian fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS1.D;Austria has always been a prosperous state that lacked a greater purpose. So today, the Kaiser has assembled the Reichsrat to discuss our further goals. A new rising movement of German nationalists has proposed to adopt Pangermanic Ideals and start working under the banner of a  'South German Federation'. However, there are a lot of imperialists who have started making plans of a 'Danubian Federation' long ago that will unite various eastern european people under our Flag.\n Warning: currently danubian path has the most flavour so it's recommeded to choose it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS1.A;We need to unite southern germans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS1a.A;Danubian destiny for us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS2.T;The Transdanubian question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS2.D;Transdanubia is a region that is equally populated by Germans and Hungarians. As a result of the recent unification of the two countries emerged a question of returning it to Hungary. Of course, this will show Hungarians that we are friends to them, but German nationalists will be outraged by this and demand that the region remain in Austria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS2.A;We should befriend hungarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS2a.A;Not a single piece of land to parasites!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS3.T;The Croatian question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS3.D;Many problems with Panslavism arose recently. Many people fear that the Slavic state in our realm can hurt our unity so they proposed to give it to Hungarians so they will keep Slavs under control. Others, however, suggest that we should adopt Panslavic ideas to some extent and promote Slavic cultures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS3.A;They will be obedient under hungarians...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS3a.A;...But I have a bad feeling about Bosnia in future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS4.T;The Transilvanian question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS4.D;Transilvania is a region population which consists of Hungarians, Romanians and old German migrants. Keeping Transilvania autonomous will allow all nationalities to get representation, but, of course, giving it to Hungary will ensure that we have full control of Romanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS4.A;We must prevent Romanian nationalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS4a.A;We will try to appease romanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS5.T;Return of Romanian lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS5.D;Transilvania managed to expand before our conquest. Keeping their newly occupied territories can be seen as an unjustified act, should we give them independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS5.A;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS5a.A;It's our land now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6.T;The Czech question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6.D;Czechs were always a big pain for Germans. Far too long they kept German ethnical lands, oppressing our brethren. To ensure assimilation of these filthy Slavs our Kaiser's noble advisors have proposed to murder Bohemian aristocrats so that their nation will lose direction making them an easy target to germanise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6.A;Death to the rats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6a.A;We shouldn't create any further ethnic conflicts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6.T;The Galician-Lodomerian question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6.D;Galicia-Lodomeria already has many conflicts between Poles and Ruthenians. It opens up a lot of possibilities to us. We can either use it to our advantage or try to lower the tensions between the two ethnicities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6.A;Prevent any ethnic conflicts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6a.A;Favour Poles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6b.A;Favour Ruthenians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS6c.A;Who said that ANY of them can have rights?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS7.T;Swiss revolt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS7.D;Our hold on Helvetia was always very fragile, but now things have spiraled out of control, and the Swiss held referenda which either declared independence or ceded land to our 'good' neighbors. With general recoginiton of a new state coming in, it might be wise to completely withdraw out of the cursed mountain lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS7.A;Let us recognise them before they cause any trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS7a.A;Bring these lands back under our control!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS8.T;Peace treaty with Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS8.D;Wonderful! We have managed to completely subjugate Venice thus forcing them out of their mainland completely! Now, as they think of what they did in exile, we can start reorganising the new lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS8.A;Glory to Danubia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS9.T;We have lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS9.D;HOW, HOW, HOW?! They are forcing us out of the mainland! We are exiled! Fuck all the generals who said that we easily can win this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS9.A;FUCK;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS10.T;The Italian question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS10.D;We might have conquered more than we can handle. To show Italians that we don't want to destroy their national identity we can grant autonomy to Lombardia and recognise their culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS10.A;We shouldn't provoke any wars of independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AUS10a.A;These dirty pigs will obey us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
