The Council is now deciding on who the best person to lead the country in the future will be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

That person is Gianni d'Angelo, a general of the Venetian army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VEN05.D;The Apennine peninsula is divided between countless minor Italian states. We have already seen in the past that a divided Italian nation is prone to foreign invasions. In order to protect the Italian people and unite the peninsula, a young and capable candidate with the ability to fearlessly lead the people has been elected.
