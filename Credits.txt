Mods we've used assets from in the making of tns:
HPM: since hfm is based on this we naturally used it too.
HFM: we based the mod mostly on HFM and re-used many files for flavor and what not.
Haralds Triumph: we used terrain and provinces from this mod that were very useful around the world.
Victoria universalis: we used some cb's (well more based on) from VU since their cbs are so well done and make wars way better.
